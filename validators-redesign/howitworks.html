            1. Submitter uploads in private workspace for pre-submission validation checks
        </h4>
        
            Pre-submission checks, such as structural and consistency validations, allow submitters to easily identify and correct data anomalies before submitting the data for assessment by reviewers.
        

            These validations  ensure the data is structured correctly and satisfies its specification, and that it appears to be reasonable and consistent, including comparison to data submitted in previous reporting periods.

            2. Submitter proposes file for review in a shared workspace
        </h4>
        
        Submitters 'propose' files for acceptance by reviewers. Once proposed, reviewers can assess the quality of the datafile via a series of issue and rule reports. Reviewers can either accept the file, or reject it if the issues are too significant.
        
        <h4 class="text-xl">
        3. Reviewer and submitter collaborate on data
        </h4>
        
        The MDS Online Validator provides a collaborative platform for receivers to work with submitters to ensure that data meets the standards required by the receiver. Issues are tracked and discussions between submitters and receivers are retained.
        
        <h4 class="text-xl">
        4. Submission is finalised
        </h4>
        
        Once the submission process is considered complete, the data is considered to be suitable for reporting and can be manually or automatically transferred to an external data warehouse or reporting system.
