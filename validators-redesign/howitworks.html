                                Pre-submission checks, such as structural and consistency validations, allow submitters to easily identify and correct data anomalies before submitting the data for assessment by reviewers.
                            
                
                                These validations  ensure the data is structured correctly and satisfies its specification, and that it appears to be reasonable and consistent, including comparison to data submitted in previous reporting periods.

                                Submitters 'propose' files for acceptance by reviewers. Once proposed, reviewers can assess the quality of the datafile via a series of issue and rule reports. Reviewers can either accept the file, or reject it if the issues are too significant.
